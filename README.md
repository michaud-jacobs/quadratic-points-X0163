Extra information about the repository to go here.

NOTES:

Sieve runs as expected and code done, need to add comments. log file added, but may need to rerun...
displaying quadratic points works and code done, need to add comments
fixed points works and code done, need to add comments
need to add comments for minor edits in AL_sieve folder
extra_checks works I think and code is pretty much done I think, need to add comments
incorporating 41 is not yet complete, need to deal with degree 2 places. It is almost there, and I have a clear path towards success.
Then will need to add comments and log file.
