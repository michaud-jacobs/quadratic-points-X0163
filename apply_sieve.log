Genus of X_0(163) is: 13
Considering X_0(163)/w_163.
rk J_0(163)(Q) = rk J_0(163)(Q)/w_163 
Genus of X_0(163) is 13
We have found these 2 cusps on X_0(163):
[
Place at (1 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 1 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0),
Place at (-1 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 1 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0)
]
We have found 6 points on X_0(163)^2(Q).
